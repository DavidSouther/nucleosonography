Just some fun with [WebAudio][2] and parts of the [NIST Basic Atomic
Spectroscopic Date Finding List][1]. This is completely bogus scientifically,
but fun programming.

## Method

Take the frequency of [emission lines][3], in angstrom (10 angstrom = 1
nanometer). Emission lines range from ~90Å to ~125kÅ, with very few above 20kÅ.
Human hearing is sensitive in the 20Hz to 20kHz. This is a purely coincidental
numeric relation, but does allow for the straightforward "conversion" of light
frequencies to sound frequencies. This periodic table, then, combines each of
the published emission spectra into an oscillator. The dozen to hundred
oscillators are then gained to their listed intensity, scaled by 1000. This
generally produces cacophony.

TURN YOUR HEADPHONES DOWN.
